    * Do not change the string arg in XS, use copy instead. Fixes perlcc -O3
      RT#96893 (Reini Urban)

    * Stop using the padlist to refcount GVs. Instead use regular magic. This
      allows various modules, including B::Deparse, to safely peek into pads of
      (re)named subs (Closes RT#42725) (Goro Fuji).
    * Support perl >= 5.13.3 by using the new CvGV_set interface there
      (Closes RT#59558).
    * Stop using the deprecated PL_no_symref (Closes RT#57843).

0.04 -- Fri Jul 18 15:23 CEST 2008
    * Fixed for perl 5.6 and 5.005 threads (tested)

0.03 -- Wed Feb 20 20:19 CET 2008
    * Fixed crash when trying to rename xsubs
    * As a side-effect, should work with 5.005 threads (untested)

0.02 -- Wed Aug 18 19:51 CEST 2004
    * Fixed documentation, which erroneously mentioned the existance of
      two exported functions.
